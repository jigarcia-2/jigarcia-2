I am a physician turned Medical Data Scientist with a strong focus on women’s health.

My work focuses on translating health data into meaningful insights, grounded in more
than 10 years of experience in real clinical and hospital settings, where data directly
impacts decisions, outcomes, and patients’ lives.

I invite you to explore my projects, which reflect my way of interpreting numbers
within their proper healthcare and clinical context.
